​Official repository for the 5D Stationary Manifold framework.
​Technical Specifications
​The Master Equation: (S · T · E · L · M) = Ψ
​The Linearity Law: L = sec(θ)
​The Invariance Principle: dΨ / dt = 0
​The Bending Ruler Effect: We propose that cosmological redshift is a result of Linearity (L) distortion in a 5D manifold, creating the illusion of expansion in a stationary universe.
